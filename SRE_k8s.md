# üöÄ Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) ‚Äì Kubernetes Most Asked Interview Questions

This document contains the most commonly asked Kubernetes questions for Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) roles, especially for professionals with 2‚Äì5 years of experience.

---

## 1. What happens when you run `kubectl apply -f pod.yaml`?

- It sends the manifest to the Kubernetes API Server.
- The API server validates and stores it in etcd.
- The scheduler assigns the pod to a suitable node.
- The kubelet on that node pulls the container image.
- The container is created and started.
- Kubelet monitors the container's health.

---

## 2. What is a `CrashLoopBackOff`?

- A pod crashes repeatedly after being started.
- Kubernetes retries but backs off (waits longer each time).
- Common causes:
  - Bad entrypoint/command
  - Missing files or config
  - Resource constraints
  - Application bug

### üîß Debug:
```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```

---

## 3. What is the difference between `Deployment`, `ReplicaSet`, and `StatefulSet`?

| Controller   | Purpose                          |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| Deployment   | Manages stateless applications   |
| ReplicaSet   | Ensures a specific number of pod replicas |
| StatefulSet  | Manages stateful apps with stable identities and storage |

---

## 4. How do you handle rolling updates in Kubernetes?

- Use `Deployment` with a rolling update strategy:
```yaml
strategy:
  type: RollingUpdate
  rollingUpdate:
    maxSurge: 1
    maxUnavailable: 1
```

- Rollback if needed:
```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment <deployment-name>
```

---

## 5. What is a `DaemonSet`?

- Ensures a pod runs on **every node** (or a subset).
- Common use cases:
  - Monitoring agents (e.g., Fluentd)
  - Log collection
  - Security daemons

---

## 6. What is `ImagePullBackOff` and how to fix it?

A pod cannot pull the image. Kubernetes is retrying with a backoff delay.

### üí° Causes:
- Typo in image name or tag
- Image not present in registry
- Missing `imagePullSecrets` for private registries
- DockerHub pull limit exceeded

### üîç Check:
```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```

---

## 7. How do you monitor Kubernetes clusters?

- **Tools**: Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager, ELK, Fluentd, Loki, Datadog
- **Metrics**: Use exporters like kube-state-metrics, node-exporter
- **Logging**: EFK stack or centralized logging systems
- **Probes**: Liveness & readiness for pod health

---

## 8. What are `readiness` and `liveness` probes?

| Probe       | Purpose                          |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
| Liveness    | Checks if the app is alive (restart if fails) |
| Readiness   | Checks if the app is ready to serve traffic  |

### Example:
```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /healthz
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 10
```

---

## 9. How do you scale a Kubernetes deployment?

### Manual Scaling:
```bash
kubectl scale deployment <name> --replicas=5
```

### Auto-scaling with HPA:
```bash
kubectl autoscale deployment <name> --cpu-percent=80 --min=2 --max=10
```

---

## 10. How do you debug a pod that‚Äôs not starting?

- Check pod status:
```bash
kubectl describe pod <name>
```

- View logs:
```bash
kubectl logs <name>
```

- View cluster events:
```bash
kubectl get events --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp
```

---

## ‚úÖ Pro Tip

Always check:
- Events section in `kubectl describe`
- Image names
- Environment variables
- Secrets/ConfigMaps
- Node status & resources

---


# Advanced Kubernetes Interview Questions for SREs (Part 2)

### ‚úÖ 11. What is a Namespace in Kubernetes?
Namespaces are used to **logically isolate resources** within the same cluster.

- Good for multi-team environments.
- Example: dev, test, prod

```bash
kubectl get ns
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```

---

### ‚úÖ 12. How does Kubernetes service discovery work?
- **ClusterIP Service** gets a virtual IP inside the cluster.
- Internal DNS (via CoreDNS) resolves service names.
- Pods can access other services using:
  ```
  http://<service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local
  ```

---

### ‚úÖ 13. What is a ConfigMap and a Secret?
- **ConfigMap**: Stores non-sensitive config like environment variables, CLI args.
- **Secret**: Stores sensitive data like passwords, tokens, certs.

```bash
kubectl create configmap my-config --from-literal=ENV=prod
kubectl create secret generic my-secret --from-literal=API_KEY=123
```

---

### ‚úÖ 14. What is `initContainer` and why is it used?
`initContainers` are special containers that run **before the main containers** in a pod.

- Used for setup tasks (e.g., wait for DB, load config).
- If an init container fails, the pod won‚Äôt start.

---

### ‚úÖ 15. How does Kubernetes handle persistent storage?
- Uses **PersistentVolume (PV)** and **PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)**.
- Storage can come from GCP Persistent Disk, AWS EBS, NFS, etc.

```yaml
volumeMounts:
  - mountPath: "/data"
    name: my-pvc
```

---

### ‚úÖ 16. What are taints and tolerations?
- **Taints** repel pods from nodes.
- **Tolerations** allow pods to run on tainted nodes.
Useful for **dedicated nodes** like GPU or infra workloads.

```bash
kubectl taint nodes node1 key=value:NoSchedule
```

---

### ‚úÖ 17. What is node affinity and pod affinity?
Used to **influence pod scheduling** based on labels.

- **Node Affinity**: Schedule pods to specific nodes.
- **Pod Affinity**: Co-locate pods on same or different nodes.

```yaml
affinity:
  nodeAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
            - key: zone
              operator: In
              values:
                - us-central1-a
```

---

### ‚úÖ 18. How do you upgrade a Kubernetes cluster safely?
- Upgrade components one by one: Control Plane ‚Üí Nodes.
- Backup etcd.
- Use `kubeadm` or managed service tools (GKE, EKS).
- Monitor workloads and rollback if needed.

---

### ‚úÖ 19. How do you ensure high availability in Kubernetes?
- Use multiple replicas (via Deployments).
- Use HPA for auto-scaling.
- Use multiple master/control plane nodes.
- Load balance services (via Service + Ingress).

---

### ‚úÖ 20. What are some production-readiness checks before deploying to Kubernetes?
- Liveness and readiness probes configured
- Resource limits and requests defined
- Logging and monitoring enabled
- Config and secrets externalized
- Proper namespace isolation and RBAC policies


# SRE Kubernetes Interview Questions ‚Äì Expert Level (Part 3)

## 1. What is the difference between a DaemonSet and a Deployment?

**Answer:**  
- **DaemonSet** ensures that a copy of a pod runs on all (or some) nodes. Commonly used for logging/monitoring agents.
- **Deployment** manages stateless applications and ensures a desired number of replicas are running.

---

## 2. How do you perform a rolling update in Kubernetes?

**Answer:**  
Using the `kubectl rollout` command or by updating the image/tag in a Deployment YAML. Kubernetes will gradually replace old pods with new ones to avoid downtime.

---

## 3. What are readiness and liveness probes?

**Answer:**  
- **Liveness probe** checks if a container is alive. If it fails, the container is restarted.
- **Readiness probe** checks if the container is ready to serve traffic. If it fails, it‚Äôs removed from the service endpoints.

---

## 4. How do you handle config and secrets in Kubernetes?

**Answer:**  
- **ConfigMaps** are used for non-sensitive configuration data.
- **Secrets** are used for storing sensitive data (like passwords, keys) and are base64 encoded.

---

## 5. How would you debug a CrashLoopBackOff error?

**Answer:**  
- Check logs: `kubectl logs <pod-name> --previous`
- Describe the pod: `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>`
- Look for issues in init containers, command syntax, or readiness probes.

---

## 6. What is a Kubernetes Service Mesh?

**Answer:**  
A service mesh (e.g., Istio, Linkerd) provides observability, traffic control, and security between services without changing application code.

---

## 7. What are taints and tolerations?

**Answer:**  
- **Taints** prevent pods from being scheduled on nodes.
- **Tolerations** allow (tolerate) pods to be scheduled on tainted nodes.

---

## 8. How can you autoscale pods in Kubernetes?

**Answer:**  
Using the **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**, which adjusts pod count based on CPU/memory utilization or custom metrics.

---

## 9. How do you upgrade a Kubernetes cluster?

**Answer:**  
- Back up etcd.
- Drain nodes.
- Upgrade control plane using `kubeadm`.
- Upgrade kubelet and kubectl on nodes.
- Uncordon nodes and verify cluster status.

---

## 10. How do you secure access to the Kubernetes API?

**Answer:**  
- Use RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
- Enable audit logging
- Use TLS certificates for authentication
- Restrict access using API server flags (`--authorization-mode`)

# üì¶ Kubernetes: Relationship between Pods, ReplicaSets, Deployments, and Namespaces

## üîπ 1. Pods
- The **smallest unit** in Kubernetes.
- Encapsulates **one or more containers** with shared storage, network, and specs.
- Pods are **ephemeral**‚Äînot recreated automatically unless managed by a controller like a ReplicaSet or Deployment.

## üîπ 2. ReplicaSets
- Maintains a **specified number of identical pod replicas**.
- Ensures pods are replaced if they fail or are deleted.
- Uses **labels and selectors** to manage groups of pods.

## üîπ 3. Deployments
- A higher-level abstraction over ReplicaSets.
- Manages:
  - **Rolling updates**
  - **Rollbacks**
  - **Scaling**
- Automatically creates and manages ReplicaSets.
- Workflow:
  ```
  Deployment ‚Üí ReplicaSet ‚Üí Pods
  ```

## üîπ 4. Namespaces
- **Logical partitions** within a Kubernetes cluster.
- Used for:
  - Isolating environments (e.g., dev, test, prod)
  - Applying **RBAC**, **resource quotas**, and **network policies**
- All other resources (Deployments, ReplicaSets, Pods) reside within a namespace.

## üîÅ Relationship Diagram

```
Namespace
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Deployment
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ReplicaSet (managed by Deployment)
           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Pod(s) (managed by ReplicaSet)
```

## üß† Summary Table

| Resource      | Purpose                                | Related To                        |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Pod**       | Runs containers                        | Managed by ReplicaSet              |
| **ReplicaSet**| Maintains number of pods               | Managed by Deployment              |
| **Deployment**| Handles updates/rollbacks              | Manages ReplicaSet                 |
| **Namespace** | Logical isolation of resources         | Contains Deployments, Pods, etc.   |

# üß© Kubernetes: When to Use a DaemonSet

A **DaemonSet** ensures that a **specific pod runs on all (or selected) nodes** in a Kubernetes cluster. It is mainly used for running background system-level services.

---

## ‚úÖ Use Cases for DaemonSet

| Use Case                         | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| üõ°Ô∏è **Monitoring agents**         | Tools like **Prometheus Node Exporter**, **Datadog Agent**, or **Telegraf** to collect metrics from each node. |
| üìÑ **Log collection agents**     | Agents like **Fluentd**, **Filebeat**, or **Logstash** to ship node/pod logs to centralized storage (e.g., ELK, Splunk). |
| üîí **Security agents**           | Antivirus, intrusion detection tools, or file integrity checkers (e.g., Falco, OSSEC) deployed on all nodes. |
| üöÄ **Custom node setup/config**  | Running scripts, network configurations, or custom agents during node bootstrap. |
| üåê **Networking components**     | CNI plugins (e.g., Calico, Cilium) or kube-proxy when deployed as a pod. |
| ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud provider integration**| Tools that interact with cloud APIs for volume mounting, node tagging, etc. |

---

## üîß Example Scenario

> You want to collect logs from all nodes using **Fluentd** and ship them to **Splunk**.  
> ‚úÖ You would use a **DaemonSet** to ensure a Fluentd pod runs on **every node** and accesses `/var/log`.

---

## üß† Key Characteristics

- Ensures **one pod per node** (or selected nodes).
- Automatically adds pods on **new nodes**.
- Cleans up pods when nodes are **removed**.
- Can be limited using **node selectors** or **taints/tolerations**.

# üõ†Ô∏è Kubernetes: How to Debug a Failing Pod

Debugging a failing pod in Kubernetes involves using built-in tools to inspect logs, events, resource status, and configuration.

---

## ‚úÖ 1. Check Pod Status
```bash
kubectl get pods
```
- Look for statuses like `CrashLoopBackOff`, `Pending`, `Error`, `OOMKilled`.

---

## ‚úÖ 2. Describe the Pod
```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```
- Shows detailed information:
  - Events
  - Node assignment
  - Scheduling issues
  - Container restarts

---

## ‚úÖ 3. Check Logs
```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```
- For multi-container pods:
```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name> -c <container-name>
```
- For previously crashed container logs:
```bash
kubectl logs --previous <pod-name>
```

---

## ‚úÖ 4. Exec Into the Pod (If Running)
```bash
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/sh
```
- Inspect environment variables, config files, logs inside the container.

---

## ‚úÖ 5. Check Events in the Namespace
```bash
kubectl get events --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp
```
- Helps spot image pull errors, scheduling issues, etc.

---

## ‚úÖ 6. Check Resource Limits
- Check if the pod is being OOMKilled or has insufficient CPU.
```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```

---

## ‚úÖ 7. Inspect Liveness & Readiness Probes
- Misconfigured probes can cause restarts or prevent traffic routing.

---

## ‚úÖ 8. Check Node Issues
```bash
kubectl describe node <node-name>
kubectl get pods -o wide  # To find which node a pod is running on
```

---

## ‚úÖ 9. Validate Image and Pull Policy
- Incorrect image names or `imagePullPolicy: Always` can cause pull errors.
```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```

---

## ‚úÖ 10. Use Ephemeral Debug Container (K8s v1.18+)
```bash
kubectl debug pod/<pod-name> -c <container-name> --image=busybox --target=<container-name> -- /bin/sh
```
- Helpful when the main container won‚Äôt start.

---

## üß† Tips
- Use `kubectl get pod <pod-name> -o yaml` to review full configuration.
- Double-check **ConfigMaps**, **Secrets**, and **Volumes** if they're mounted correctly.

---

# üîç Kubernetes Probes: Liveness, Readiness, and Startup

Kubernetes uses three types of probes to manage container lifecycle and health.

---

## ‚úÖ 1. Liveness Probe

- **Purpose:** Checks if the container is still running (not stuck or crashed).
- **Action on failure:** Kubernetes restarts the container.
- **Typical use case:** Detect deadlocks, memory leaks, or hung processes.

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /healthz
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 5
```

---

## üì∂ 2. Readiness Probe

- **Purpose:** Checks if the container is ready to accept traffic.
- **Action on failure:** Pod is removed from the Service's endpoint list.
- **Typical use case:** Wait until app is fully initialized (e.g., DB connection ready).

```yaml
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /ready
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 5
```

---

## ‚è≥ 3. Startup Probe

- **Purpose:** Checks if the container has started successfully.
- **Note:** Disables liveness and readiness until it passes.
- **Typical use case:** For slow-starting apps (e.g., Spring Boot, Java).

```yaml
startupProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /startup
    port: 8080
  failureThreshold: 30
  periodSeconds: 10
```

---

## üß† Summary Table

| Probe Type     | Purpose                               | Failure Action                        | Use Case Example                       |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Liveness        | Is the container alive?                | Restart the container                 | Unresponsive/stuck app                 |
| Readiness       | Is the container ready for traffic?    | Remove from service endpoints         | App initializing DB                    |
| Startup         | Has the container started properly?    | Restart the container                 | Slow-starting apps (Java/Spring Boot)  |
